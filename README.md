# hello-next

## What is this?

Following [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/works-with-anything).

The "twists" are that I'm using Preact X (Preact 10rc) with emotion CSS
(Ok, the latter part isn't a bit twist, but the first part required me to learn how the Next.js config works).

On lesson #3 now.

Got distracted on lesson #2 when I was experimenting with buttons and then a DIY CSS framework using `emotion`

## Todo:

* Set up emotion's SSR with Next.js
* Figure out a way to use pure Preact mixed with preact/compat?
